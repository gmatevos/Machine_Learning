# About The Project
During my Petroleum Engineering days I was always dealing with data analytics, but at some point I ran out of tools from my toolbox.  I decided to learn data science on my own time and started with reading books referenced at the end.  The biggest challenge for me was lack of structured examples that capture modeling process from start to finish :raised_eyebrow:.

I started organizing the materials and putting the pieces of the puzzle together during the learning process.  Now I'm hoping people that are facing the same challanges can utilize this material to answer some of their own questions.  I'm hoping this repository will be useful and informative for people on their own ML path.

This repository contains a multitude of examples on how to build machine learning models using sklearn.

All the material was put together from the personal learning experience and covers the following topics:
1. EDA
2. Preprocessing
3. Feature selection / extraction
4. Modeling
5. Evaluations and improvements

ML Cheat Sheet was put together to summarize the modeling workflow and differing techniques for building a model.  

References below were utilized for putting together this guide and learning modeling procedures.  
I'd stongly suggest reading the references below in the mentioned order to learn and understand how to build ML models.
