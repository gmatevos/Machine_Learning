# Machine_Learning
This repository contains a multitude of examples on how to build machine learning models using sklearn.  All the materials were put together myself with references below.  Each model built in this repository was built and tuned myself.

All the material was put together from the personal learning experience and covers the following topics:
1. EDA
2. Preprocessing
3. Feature selection / extraction
4. Modeling
5. Evaluations and improvements

ML Cheat Sheet was put together to summarize the modeling workflow and differing techniques for building a model.  

References below were utilized for putting together this guide and learning modeling procedures.  
I'd stongly suggest reading the references below in the mentioned order to learn and understand how to build ML models.
