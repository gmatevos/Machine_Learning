# Machine_Learning
This repository contains a multitude of examples on how to build classificaiton and regression machine learning models using sklearn.

ML Cheat Sheet was put together to summarize the modeling workflow and differing techniques for building a model.

All the material was put together from the personal learning experience and covers the following topics:
1. EDA
2. Preprocessing
3. Feature selection / extraction
4. Modeling
5. Evaluations and improvements

References below were utilized for putting together this guide and learning modeling procedures.  

I'd stongly suggest to read the references below in the mentioned order to learn and understand how to build ML models.
